Steam Trade Offers Client for Python
=======

`steampy` is a library for Python, inspired by node-steam-tradeoffers, node-steam and others libraries for Node.js.
It was designed simple lightweight library, combining features of many steam libraries from Node.js in one python module.
`steampy` is capable of logging to steam, fetching trade offers and handle them in simple manner, using steam user credentials
and SteamGuard file(no need to extract and pass sessionID and webCookie).
`steampy` is developed with Python 3 using type hints and many other features.
